<!--A brief description of some of the things that I am interested in-->
      <p>My name is Jacob Kolker and I am studying Information Technology
        Management at Illinois Institute of Technology.  I hope to use this
        degree to be a Network Administrator or manage the entire IT department
        of a small business.  I am especially passionate about Cisco Networking
        and virtualization in general. I have several certifications from many
        of the large companies in the IT world such as Cisco, VMware, Microsoft,
        and CompTIA. I also like cars, mainly old ones.  My favorite car is the
        1993 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue.  I also like to build things,
        for example, this past summer I built my own speaker cabinets.</p>
